current bugs:

GAMEPLAY:

September 10, 2012
-- If a player moves fast enough, they can move blocks over top of empty spaces
   very quickly in succession to have blocks float over more than one empty
   space before they will stop falling. If the time the player manages to make
   more than one move is less than one clock cycle (which also checks to see if a
   block is in animation (the swapping animation for instance) before allowing
   this block to start falling).
   === Possible fix includes checkFalling() every time a player performs a swap (either
       in the swap code or on buttons Z or X are pressed).

--  I think the square_falling / dropping animation needs to be slowed down
    by using a different animation instead of the same one used for swapping
    blocks.

GRAPHICS / RESIZING:

September 10, 2012
-- When blocks fall, they still do not play a wobbling animation. Just sayin'.

August 28, 2012
-- 	Reverse instructions only does half before it starts going backwards...
-- 	Floating point / rounding error in TransitionMenu() is causing the last value of Y
	to become distorted and move by +/- 1 pixels.
--  If window is resized before game starts, the cursor doesn't move up the screen at the
    same speed as the blocks. (The blocks take global scale into account, the cursor does not)

	
OTHER:

September 3, 2012
--  Memory problem: allGraphics (and presumably animatedGraphics) vectors
    are constantly growing with new Blocks taking up memory and are never
    being resized. The old blocks are not being disposed of properly so if
    the game goes on for too long, memory usage becomes an issue.
    
September 6, 2012
-- Might be a good idea to make the Grid() a static object that the blocks themselves can manipulate
   with their setGridLocation() methods, instead of the grid doing it and then passing it along
   and just hoping that it all stays in sync. This way, each block deals with their own place on the
   grid and to manipulate it, you have to go directly through the block that is sitting there.
   Or I guess you could overwrite it with another block, but then that block will never be addressed
   again... Hmmmmm
   Either way, the lack of a proper "pointing" system is causing problems.
